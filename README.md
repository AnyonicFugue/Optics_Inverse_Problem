# Optic inverse problem CUDA
 
 This is my final project for the course Optics in 2021 Fall.
 
The folder *Collection of Usable Programs* collects the main versions.

Other folders contain different versions of the program. The final version is *CUDA*, where I used the Python package *numba* to call GPUs.
